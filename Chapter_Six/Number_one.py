Discussion: Dictionary Methods


a) In Python, there’s no dedicated add method for dictionaries.
To add a new key–value pair, you simply assign it directly, for example: my_dict["name"] = "John".


b) The keys() method returns a view object of all the keys in the dictionary,
almost like seeing the dictionary’s headings at a glance.


c) The values() method returns a view object containing all the values stored in the dictionary,
letting you see the data itself without the keys.


d) The items() method gives you both keys and values together as (key, value) pairs,
which is especially useful when you want to loop through the entire dictionary and access both parts at once
